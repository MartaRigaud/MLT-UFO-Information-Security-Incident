#sCuDO: Information Security Incident Domain Ontology supported by Multi-Level Theory 

This ontology was created using UFO-MLT. The first model (Figure 1 - UFO-MLT Incident) exhibit overall elements of the domain. In these context, an Incident is an instance of a Complex Event because it consists of one or more Attack (Atomic Event) committed by the same Attacker to reach a certain Damage (Situation).

As an Event, Attack depends on the participation of objects. Person, Information Asset and Tool are objects participants of an Attack. A Person, playing the role of the Attacker, Raise a sort of Tool, playing the role of Malicious, to execute an Attack. When the Attack happens, it looks for some Information Asset in the Vulnerable pre-state. Then, the action of the Attack produces an unauthorized result. So, the Information Asset before the attack is in the Vulnerable situation and then goes to Unauthorized Result situation. The set of unauthorized results of attacks in an incident leads to a Damage situation. 
	
Some of these entities of the Information Security Incident ontology were classified in levels  , as follow:


- Information Asset (Figura 2  - UFO-MLT Incident Information Asset): illustrates the types of information assets that participate of Incident.


- Incident Tool (Figura 3  - UFO-MLT Incident Tool): illustratres the Kind of Tool leading an  attack.


- Incident Situation (Figura 4  - UFO-MLT Incident Situation): illustrates the types of situations that occurr in Incident.


- Incident Role Person (Figura 5  - UFO-MLT Incident Role Person): illustrates the roles that a person may play during an Incident.


- Attack (Figura 6  - UFO-MLT Type Attack): illustrates the categories of the attack.


- DDoS Attack classification (Figure 7  - UFO-MLT DDoS Attack classification criterion): illlustrates DDoS attack classification according to the attack method.


- DDoS Attack (Figure 8  - MLT Type DDoS Attack): illustrates types of DDoS attacks.



- Iranian incident (Figure 9  - UFO-MLT Iranian incident): scenario application of sCuDO.
